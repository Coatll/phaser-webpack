# Phaser 3 Webpack Boilerplate

Get up and running with Phaser 3 using JavaScript ES6.

This Webpack setup takes care of your code bundling and local server.

Additionally, I have included some basic ES6 classes to demonstrate how to extend Phaser's base classes and implement player controls.

## Installation

```
npm i
```

## Tasks

Run the development server to preview locally.
```
npm start
```

Create a release build.
```
npm run build
```
